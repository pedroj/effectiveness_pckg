\description{
Data from a study on Prunus mahaleb (Rosaceae) seed dispersal by frugivorous
animals in SE Spain.
Variables include:
# Visitation data come from 107.3 h direct watches.
abundance-          Mean no. birds censused/km, averaged for two study years.
visits-             Mean no. visitis recorded to fruiting trees (/10 h).
prop_visits-        Proportion of total visits recorded (feeding records)
                    contributed by species. Relative to the total no. 
                    records in two study years.
eff_per_vis-        Mean no. fruits swallowed per visit (successfully 
                    dispersed seeds).
eff_total-          Visit rate * eff_per_vis*prop fruits swallowed.
prop_disp_service-  Proportion of total dispersal service contributed by
                    species.
